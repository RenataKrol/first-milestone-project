                  The Monkees are an American rock and pop band, they were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider.
                  In 1965, over 400 people responded to an ad seeking young men for a new television show about a rock group called The Monkees.
                  The Monkees, starring Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork premiered on September 12, 1966, and audiences 
                  adored the humorous antics of the band. Though made for TV, The Monkees had real-life hits and struggled against their "Pre-Fab Four" image.
                  Some of their best-loved and number one hits included Neil Diamond's "I'm a Believer" and "Last Train to Clarksville." More successful singles followed,
                  including another Neil Diamond song, "Little Bit Me, Little Bit You," Gerry Goffin and Carole King's "Pleasant Valley Sunday",
                  and "Daydream Believer" by John Stewart of the Kingston Trio.
